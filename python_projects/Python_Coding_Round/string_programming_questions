Certainly! Here are some **interview-style Python string problems** similar to your example (case-insensitive comparison, uniqueness, frequency, ordering):

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **First Non-Repeating Character (Case-Insensitive)**

**Problem:**
Given a string, return the first character that doesnâ€™t repeat (ignoring case).
**Example:**
`"Swiss"` â†’ `'w'`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Remove Characters That Appear More Than Once (Case-Insensitive)**

**Problem:**
From a string, remove characters that appear more than once regardless of case.
**Example:**
`"Programming"` â†’ `"Po"`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Check for Anagram (Case-Insensitive)**

**Problem:**
Check if two strings are anagrams of each other, ignoring case.
**Example:**
`"Listen"` and `"Silent"` â†’ `True`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Group Characters by Case**

**Problem:**
Separate uppercase and lowercase characters while preserving the original order.
**Example:**
`"AaSsBi"` â†’ `Uppercase: 'ASB', Lowercase: 'asi'`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Count Characters That Appear Only Once (Case-Insensitive)**

**Problem:**
Count how many characters appear exactly once in the string, case-insensitive.
**Example:**
`"Teeter"` â†’ Output: 2 (characters: 'r', 't')

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Find All Unique Characters (Preserve Order)**

**Problem:**
Print all characters that appear only once (case-insensitive) in the original order.
**Example:**
`"AaSsBi"` â†’ `"Bi"`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Are Two Strings Isomorphic (Case-Insensitive)?**

**Problem:**
Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in one string can be replaced to get the second string.
**Example:**
`"foo"` and `"app"` â†’ `True`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. **Longest Substring with Unique Characters**

**Problem:**
Find the length of the longest substring with all unique characters (case-sensitive or insensitive as needed).
**Example:**
`"abcABC"` â†’ `6`
